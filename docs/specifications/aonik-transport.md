# Aonik transport & tenancy seam — the real HttpAonikClient

## Why

`web/src/lib/aonik/client.ts` was written before the Aonik commerce API existed. Its
`HttpAonikClient` paths (`/dishes`, `/box-pricing`, `/delivery-window`, …) are self-described
first guesses, and its `Authorization: Bearer AONIK_API_KEY` auth model does not match how
Aonik actually works. The commerce API now exists (Aonik Specs 066–072, all merged): every
route lives under `/commerce/...`, every request is tenant-partitioned by an `X-Tenant-Id`
header, catalog reads are anonymous, money is served in **decimal major units** while this
frontend works in **integer pence**, and cacheability is signalled per-endpoint.

This spec replaces the guessed transport with the real one. It is the foundation the other
four integration specs (`catalog-browse`, `server-box-cart`, `review-checkout`,
`customer-identity`) build on — nothing in the component tree changes; the reconciliation is
confined to `client.ts` exactly as that file promised.

## What changes

- MODIFIED aonik-transport — `HttpAonikClient` targets the real Aonik routes with
  `X-Tenant-Id` on every request; catalog reads send no credential (breaking: no — mock mode
  is untouched and remains the default without `AONIK_API_URL`)
- ADDED aonik-transport — money adapter between Aonik decimal major units and frontend pence
  (FR-1)
- ADDED aonik-transport — typed `AonikError` taxonomy mapping Aonik's error envelope
  (FR-2)
- ADDED aonik-transport — storefront config document fetch
  (`GET /commerce/config/storefront`) as the source of currency, labels, page size, delivery
  display amounts, default box slug and extras collection slug (FR-3)
- ADDED aonik-transport — caching policy per endpoint class (catalog ISR 300 s; cart,
  checkout and identity always `no-store`) (FR-4)
- ADDED aonik-transport — `.env.example` documenting `AONIK_API_URL` + `AONIK_TENANT_ID`;
  the unused `AONIK_API_KEY` guess is removed (FR-5)

## Requirements

### Requirement: Tenant header on every request
`capability: aonik-transport` · `delta: MODIFIED (feat/aonik-transport)`

The system SHALL send `X-Tenant-Id: <AONIK_TENANT_ID>` on every request to Aonik, and SHALL
treat the tenant id as server-only configuration (a non-`NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable), alongside
`AONIK_API_URL`.

Aonik partitions all storefront data by tenant and varies its shared-cache responses on this
header (`Vary: X-Tenant-Id`). A request without it resolves no tenant and returns errors or
empty data.

#### Scenario: Catalog read carries the tenant
- **WHEN** `getDishes()` runs with `AONIK_API_URL` and `AONIK_TENANT_ID` configured
- **THEN** the request is `GET {base}/commerce/catalog/products` with header
  `X-Tenant-Id: {tenantId}`
- **AND** no `Authorization` header is sent (catalog reads are anonymous)

#### Scenario: Missing tenant id fails fast at startup, not per-request
- **WHEN** `AONIK_API_URL` is set but `AONIK_TENANT_ID` is not
- **THEN** `getAonikClient()` throws a configuration error naming the missing variable
- **AND** the error never reaches a customer page in production builds (build-time or
  boot-time check)

### Requirement: Money adapter — Aonik decimals to frontend pence
`capability: aonik-transport` · `delta: ADDED (feat/aonik-transport)`

The system SHALL convert every monetary amount received from Aonik (decimal major units,
e.g. `95.0` meaning £95.00) into integer pence at the transport seam using
`Math.round(amount * 100)`, and SHALL convert pence back to decimal major units
(`pence / 100`) on any amount it sends. Components continue to see pence only.

#### Scenario: Box plan prices arrive in pence
- **WHEN** Aonik serves a box preset priced `95.0` in `GBP`
- **THEN** the mapped `BoxOffer.pricePence` is `9500`

#### Scenario: Signed adjustments survive the round trip
- **WHEN** Aonik serves a personalisation adjustment of `-2.5`
- **THEN** the mapped pence value is `-250`
- **AND** re-encoding it for a quote request produces `-2.5` exactly

### Requirement: Typed error taxonomy
`capability: aonik-transport` · `delta: ADDED (feat/aonik-transport)`

The system SHALL map non-2xx Aonik responses into a typed `AonikError` carrying `status`,
`code` (when the body names one), `detail`, and — for `409` box-drift responses — the
refreshed box payload that rides the error body. Known codes the storefront must branch on:

| Code | Meaning | Storefront reaction |
|---|---|---|
| `commerce.option_validation` | A personalisation selection violates the product's option rules (Aonik Spec 066 V-rules) | Inline validation message on the personaliser |
| `commerce.storefront_validation` | A cart/box rule was violated (capacity, availability, size bounds, add-on rules) | Inline message; refresh the box state |
| `commerce.box_drift` (HTTP 409) | The catalogue changed under the cart at continue/checkout; the response carries the repaired box + `changes[]` | Re-render the box from the payload and show the change notices (see `server-box-cart`) |
| plain `404` | Unknown OR unauthorized — deliberately indistinguishable (fail-closed access) | Generic not-found handling; never "wrong token" copy |
| `401` / `403` | Missing/expired customer session on an authenticated route | Send to sign-in (see `customer-identity`) |

#### Scenario: Drift 409 exposes the refreshed box
- **WHEN** checkout returns HTTP 409 with code `commerce.box_drift` and a refreshed box body
- **THEN** the thrown `AonikError` has `status === 409`, `code === 'commerce.box_drift'`
- **AND** `error.box` contains the parsed refreshed box + quote + changes

#### Scenario: 404 is opaque
- **WHEN** any cart route returns 404
- **THEN** the error carries no distinction between "cart does not exist" and "not yours"
- **AND** no UI copy speculates about which it was

### Requirement: Storefront config document
`capability: aonik-transport` · `delta: ADDED (feat/aonik-transport)`

The system SHALL fetch `GET /commerce/config/storefront` (anonymous, cacheable, never 404s)
and expose it as the single source of: `currency` (canonical tenant currency), 
`recommendedChoiceLabel` (the "Abby's choice" label text), `resultsPageSize`,
`backToTopTrigger` (verbatim JSON), `delivery.listAmount` / `delivery.chargedAmount`
(display amounts: struck-through list vs charged-now; 0 renders as free), `defaultBoxSlug`
(which bundle product the box builder uses), `extrasCollectionSlug`, and `box` (the default
bundle's embedded size plan: `minSize`, `maxSize`, `currency`, `perSpacePrice?`,
`presets[{size, price, badge?, blurb?, saving?}]`, or null when unset).

Hard-coded storefront copies of any of these values SHALL be removed as pages adopt the
document (per the sibling specs).

#### Scenario: Config resolves once per request tree
- **WHEN** the homepage renders (featured rail + box offers + delivery promise)
- **THEN** `/commerce/config/storefront` is fetched at most once for that render
- **AND** its values thread to the components that need them as props

#### Scenario: Unconfigured tenant still renders
- **WHEN** the tenant has authored no storefront settings
- **THEN** the document still returns (Aonik serves defaults; the endpoint never 404s)
- **AND** the storefront renders with those defaults rather than crashing

### Requirement: Caching policy per endpoint class
`capability: aonik-transport` · `delta: ADDED (feat/aonik-transport)`

The system SHALL apply Next.js caching as follows:

| Endpoint class | Fetch policy |
|---|---|
| Catalog reads (`/commerce/catalog/*`), storefront config | `next: { revalidate: 300 }` (matches Aonik's `public, max-age=300`) |
| Delivery promise (`/commerce/config/delivery`) | `next: { revalidate: 300 }`; a 404 response is NOT cached (render "no promise") |
| Product content resolution with `v` param | `revalidate: 300` only when passing the current `contentVersion`; treat any other `v` as uncacheable |
| Cart routes (`/commerce/carts/*`), checkout, adopt | `cache: 'no-store'` — always |
| Identity (registration, token), my-orders | `cache: 'no-store'` — always |

#### Scenario: Cart calls are never cached
- **WHEN** any cart mutation or read runs
- **THEN** the fetch uses `cache: 'no-store'`
- **AND** no cart payload is ever served from the Next data cache

### Requirement: Environment contract
`capability: aonik-transport` · `delta: ADDED (feat/aonik-transport)`

The system SHALL add `web/.env.example` documenting: `AONIK_API_URL` (base URL, no trailing
slash), `AONIK_TENANT_ID` (tenant GUID). The `AONIK_API_KEY` variable and its
`Authorization: Bearer` header SHALL be removed from `HttpAonikClient` — Aonik's anonymous
storefront surface takes no service credential, and customer-authenticated calls use the
session established in `customer-identity` (never a static key).

#### Scenario: Mock mode unchanged
- **WHEN** `AONIK_API_URL` is absent
- **THEN** `getAonikClient()` returns `MockAonikClient` exactly as today

---

## Design

### Architectural decision

**All reconciliation stays inside `lib/aonik/`.** `client.ts` promised "the reconciliation is
confined to this class" — this spec holds it to that. The `AonikClient` interface keeps its
shape (pence, existing type names); a new private mapping layer (`lib/aonik/map.ts`)
converts Aonik DTOs → frontend types, and a private `aonikFetch` helper owns base URL,
tenant header, error mapping and cache policy. Components and pages import nothing new.

A second decision: **the tenant id is configuration, not code**. AbbysTable is one tenant of
a multi-tenant platform (Aonik ADR-013 — product identity is configuration); nothing in this
repo may assume it is the only storefront Aonik serves.

### Target architecture

```
Server Component / Route Handler
        │
        ▼
AonikClient (interface — UNCHANGED, pence-denominated)
        │
        ├── MockAonikClient (fixtures — unchanged, default without AONIK_API_URL)
        │
        └── HttpAonikClient
                │  getDishes() … getExtras()
                ▼
            map.ts  ←— DTO→frontend-type mapping + pence adapter (toPence/toMajor)
                │
                ▼
            aonikFetch(path, { cache, revalidate, session? })
                │  base = AONIK_API_URL
                │  headers: X-Tenant-Id: AONIK_TENANT_ID (+ Authorization when session)
                │  !ok → parse body → throw AonikError{status, code, detail, box?}
                ▼
            Aonik commerce API (/commerce/…)
```

Aonik responses use standard JSON casing (`camelCase`) — `ProductSummaryDto.HeroImageUrl`
arrives as `heroImageUrl`, etc. The mapping layer is the only place allowed to know Aonik
property names.

---

## Tasks
- [ ] Add `lib/aonik/http.ts`: `aonikFetch` (base URL, `X-Tenant-Id`, cache policy knobs,
      `AonikError` with drift-payload capture)
- [ ] Add `lib/aonik/map.ts`: `toPence` / `toMajor` + per-DTO mappers (filled in by the
      sibling specs as each surface lands)
- [ ] Rewrite `HttpAonikClient` methods onto real routes via `aonikFetch` + `map.ts`
- [ ] Add `getStorefrontConfig()` to `AonikClient` (fixture: sensible mock document)
- [ ] Remove `AONIK_API_KEY` usage; add `AONIK_TENANT_ID`; boot-time config validation
- [ ] Add `web/.env.example`
- [ ] Remove/deprecate fixture paths as sibling specs land (tracked there, not here)

### Testing
- Unit: `toPence`/`toMajor` rounding (including negatives and `.005` cases);
  `AonikError` parsing (code envelope, 409 drift body, empty body); config-validation throw.
- Integration: `aonikFetch` against a mocked `fetch` asserting header, URL join, cache
  policy per class; `getStorefrontConfig()` end-to-end against recorded Aonik JSON.

### Definition of done
All scenarios pass; typecheck and build are green; a reviewer has signed off.
